This is a Chrome [user script](http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/user-scripts/) that adds [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) support to [Formspring](http://formspring.me). It should also work with Firefox through [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), but this hasn't been tested.

This script is based on the [GitHub Flavored Markdown live preview](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/preview.html), which itself uses the [Showdown](http://softwaremaniacs.org/playground/showdown-highlight/) library. It differs slightly from standard Markdown in sensible ways. You'll figure it out.

To install it, just [click here](https://raw.github.com/Cairnarvon/formdown/master/formdown.user.js).
